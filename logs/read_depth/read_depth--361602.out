Error in rule read_depth:
    jobid: 0
    input: list/depth.list
    output: depth/stats/depth_statistics.tsv
    log: log/depth_statistics.log (check log file(s) for error details)
    shell:
        
    Rscript scripts/read_depth.R list/depth.list depth/stats/depth_statistics.tsv 2> log/depth_statistics.log 
    
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
Depth file does not exist
Population pair file for 2Dsfs and fst does not exist
Population combination file for Dstats does not exist
